## Description

Project developed for the code challenge of the Customer Success Engineer job, from Croct. It aims to demonstrate the use of the "Croct" customization library. Personalization has been applied in order to display the user's local weather, giving him the option to check the weather in another location if he so chooses.

## Features
<div align='justify'>
The website presents, on a single screen, the city, temperature, wind speed, humidity rate and the prediction for the following four days. The Croct-PlugReact library was used to search the location based on the user's IP. Subsequently, this data was used to obtain the latitude and longitude of the address, using the React Geocode library. This data was applied to the React Open Weather library API. In addition, through state variables, it was possible to present the possibility of inserting another location to obtain meteorological data.
